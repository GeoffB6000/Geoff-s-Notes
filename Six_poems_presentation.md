## Eliza Knipe/Elizabeth Cobbold
1765 - 1824

"In 1783 the family was in Manchester and Elizabeth's first collection of poetry was published there. She met Sir Joshua Reynolds in a London bookshop and dedicated her third work, *Six Narrative Poems*, to him in 1787; four years later, when her fourth work appeared, the Knipes were at Liverpool and there Elizabeth married William Clarke (bap. 1731, d. 1791) at St Ann's Church on 16 November 1790."

"Her second husband, John Cobbold (1746–1835), was a prosperous Ipswich brewer and banker, a pillar of the established church and the blue party and only twenty years her senior."

"An engaging speaker, Elizabeth founded, presided over, and raised funds for her Ipswich charities: the lying-in charity, the Society for Clothing the Infant Poor, and the annual charity bazaar."

"From 1806 the highlight of each year at Cliff House was the valentine party for which Cobbold employed her greatest skill in advance: designing and making up to eighty scissors-cut valentines to present to each of the unmarried guests and mounting them with an appropriate poem on red or blue paper."

"The valentine parties ran until 1822 when Elizabeth Cobbold was prevented by illness from holding one as usual, and two years later she was struck down by 'an alarming illness' in July, which, returning in October, rendered her unconscious for the week before she died on 17 October 1824."

"Elizabeth's portrait conveys a comfortable, lovable personality; posthumous tributes praised her very diverse skills, but it is only the productions of her scissors that have enduring merit."

## "Thesis"
While Knipe is best known as a cut paper artist, her collection of *Six Narrative Poems* deserves critical attention for its interaction with the movement to abolish slavery in Liverpool.

## Abolitionists
### Mr. Edward Rushton
Edward Rushton (1756–1814), poet and slavery abolitionist in Liverpool

"In 1773, while on a slave ship to Guinea, Rushton survived a sinking, then later that year on a slaver heading for Dominica he became so sickened by the brutal treatment of the slaves that he was charged with mutiny after remonstrating with the captain. Many of the slaves had contracted the highly contagious ophthalmia, which had spread like wildfire in the appalling conditions. Rushton took pity on them and tried to bring what relief he could. He caught the disease himself, entirely lost the sight of his left eye, and suffered from an opacity of the right cornea."

"The experience of his travels and the injustices he had witnessed led to the publication in 1782 of Rushton's first poem, *The Dismembered Empire*, a condemnation of the American War of Independence. In 1797 he wrote to former President George Washington questioning his hypocrisy in retaining slaves for his own use while fighting for liberty and independence. He wrote in similar fashion to Thomas Paine but both turned a deaf ear and did not reply. His abhorrence of the slave trade was reflected in *The West Indian Eclogues*, the first of his poems on the subject published in 1787. So well known had Rushton's reputation and views become that Thomas Clarkson sought him out while on a visit to Liverpool to credit his contribution to the abolitionist cause."

"In the late 1780s Rushton regularly met a dozen or so associates in a society which is thought to have been the forerunner of the ill-fated radical Debating Society formed by William Roscoe and the surgeon James Currie in 1795. Here, with the help of his companions, Rushton formulated the idea of raising funds to provide care for the numerous local blind paupers."

### Mr. William Roscoe
William Roscoe (1753–1831), patron of the arts, historian, slavery abolitionist in Liverpool

"As early as 1773 Roscoe and his friends founded a Society of Encouragement of the Arts, Painting and Design, which organized in Liverpool the first public exhibition of paintings held in any English town outside London."

"At this time Roscoe became increasingly involved in political activity and at the 1806 election was invited to stand for parliament as an independent candidate for Liverpool. His campaign proved successful and in an early speech calling for an honourable peace with France and parliamentary reform, he spoke in favour of the abolition of the slave trade. In his speech at the debate preceding the passing of the bill for the abolition of the slave trade, he concluded: *I have long resided in the town of Liverpool: for thirty years I have never ceased to condemn this inhuman traffic: and I consider it the greatest happiness of my life to lift up my voice on this occasion against it, with the friends of justice and humanity.*"

"On his return to Liverpool after his triumph in parliament (in 1806), Roscoe found himself at the centre of a riot orchestrated by local slave traders which hastened the end of his brief parliamentary career."

Macnaughton, Donald A. "Roscoe, William." *Oxford Dictionary of National Biography*. 2004. Web
### Doctor Currie
James Currie (1756-1805), surgeon

"Currie's early life had made him hate bigotry, captivity, and slavery. In Liverpool he worked behind the scenes for abolition of the slave trade. With Roscoe he wrote a poem entitled *The African*, and for years he corresponded with William Wilberforce, supplying him with devastating information about the slave trade."

DeLacy, Margaret. "Currie, James." *Oxford Dictionary of National Biography*. 2004. Web

### Rev. _ Newton
John Newton (1725-1807), slave trader, Church of England clergyman.

"Newton has sometimes been accused of hypocrisy for holding strong religious convictions at the same time as being active in the slave trade, praying above deck while his human cargo was in abject misery below deck. He was not, however, within the orbit of evangelicals such as John Wesley, who had advanced views against slavery, until he had already left the sea. He was a typical European of his time. Later in life he had deep regrets and repented of his involvement in the traffic, supported William Wilberforce in his abolition crusade, gave evidence to the privy council, and wrote a tract supporting abolition, *Thoughts upon the African Slave Trade* (1787)."

## Other artists and Literary Figures
### Willaim Hayley, Esq.
William Hayley (1745-1820), poet and biographer

- began his literary career by writing plays; when these failed to find consistent success he turned to poetry.

"He composed more than 140 epitaphs and his odes, intended to cheer, sympathize, or celebrate, drew the attention of strangers to him from which a firm friendship would often ensue. Friends found that Hayley would unhesitatingly go to extraordinary lengths to assist those experiencing times of distress."

"Hayley revelled in being close to talented people; he enjoyed bolstering their confidences, forwarding suggestions for their career advancement, and providing seclusion at Eartham, near Chichester, Sussex (where he had moved in 1774), so that their work might continue uninterrupted. He attempted to exert a near absolute control over his friends, guiding their personal and professional lives. Some, such as George Romney and William Cowper, appreciated his suggestions and willingly acquiesced to his advice but others, William Blake included, rebelled against the suffocating friendship and preferred to distance themselves from this well-meaning man and conduct a cordial relationship from afar."

### George Romney, Esq.
George Romney (1734-1802), painter

Between 1776 and 1796 "Romney would remain, in terms of output, London's most fashionable portrait painter."

"In the summer of 1776 Romney was introduced to the poet William Hayley. The two men quickly became close friends... John Romney later regarded Hayley as a bad influence on his father, but Hayley's company acted as a release for many of the suppressed tensions in Romney's life."

### Mr. John Braithwaite
John Braithwaite the elder (bap. 1760, d. 1818), engineer and diver

- Made a living salvaging shipwrecks using his family's diving machine

"Between August 1787 and February 1791 Braithwaite brought up goods from the East Indiaman Hartwell, wrecked after a mutiny on her maiden voyage in 1787 on the Rifona Reef off Boavista, one of the Cape Verde Islands. As well as facing technical challenges the Braithwaites here encountered armed opposition from American privateers seeking to raid the salvaged cargo... The tiny Endeavour, lightly armed and with a crew of only nine, engaged the five pirate vessels for over an hour, finally driving them off at the cost of only minor injuries. Braithwaite returned with £38,000 in Spanish dollars, 7000 pigs of lead, and 360 boxes of tin. He also brought back Eliza or Elizabeth Doile (c.1775–1814), a Verdian planter's daughter, and they married at St Pancras parish church on 3 June 1794, the anniversary of the Boavista skirmish."

### Mrs. Griffith
Elizabeth Griffith (1727–1793), playwright and novelist

- had a spirited correspondence with Richard Griffith (unrelated), who had charm and connections but no money. They married in secret despite the financial difficulties involved, and Elizabeth pushed herself to publish plays and novels in London.

"It was at this point of financial desperation that the Griffiths decided to publish their courtship letters under fictional names. A Series of Genuine Letters between Henry and Frances appeared in 1757, causing an immediate literary sensation. As a model example of sentimental romance blended with witty exchange and moral bite, the letters established the fame but not the fortune of their authors."

"While Griffith's writing is spritely and shows a sure sense of dramatic pace, critical reactions were extremely harsh. The London theatrical establishment resented the audacity of a woman playwright's claims for respect and admiration. If Griffith was to be able to support her children as a playwright, she would have to conform to contemporary sexual stereotypes rather than challenge the orthodoxy."

From Griffith's own preface to *Novellettes, selected for the use of young ladies and gentlemen, written by Dr Goldsmith, Mrs Griffith …*: "Mrs. GRIFFITH, the ornament and pride of her country, has strove to open the flood-gate of Literature to her own Sex, and purifying the stream from the filth with which it was impregnated to make it guide [sic] with meandering invitation through the vallies of Britain. She is one of the many examples in the present day, that have served to explode the illiberal assertion that Female genius is inferior to Male."

### Mr. Richard Wainwright
Richard Wainwright (bap. 1757, d. 1825), chorister and musician of multiple instruments in Liverpool.

"He was also apparently a cellist at the Manchester Gentlemen's Concerts, and may have been both the Mr Wainwright who led many local performances of Handel's oratorios as first violinist, and the one who at the Liverpool and Manchester music festivals between 1784 and 1789 variously played in the orchestra, played the organ, and conducted."
