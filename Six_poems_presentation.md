## Eliza Knipe/Elizabeth Cobbold
1765 - 1824

"In 1783 the family was in Manchester and Elizabeth's first collection of poetry was published there. She met Sir Joshua Reynolds in a London bookshop and dedicated her third work, *Six Narrative Poems*, to him in 1787; four years later, when her fourth work appeared, the Knipes were at Liverpool and there Elizabeth married William Clarke (bap. 1731, d. 1791) at St Ann's Church on 16 November 1790."

"Her second husband, John Cobbold (1746–1835), was a prosperous Ipswich brewer and banker, a pillar of the established church and the blue party and only twenty years her senior."

"An engaging speaker, Elizabeth founded, presided over, and raised funds for her Ipswich charities: the lying-in charity, the Society for Clothing the Infant Poor, and the annual charity bazaar."

"From 1806 the highlight of each year at Cliff House was the valentine party for which Cobbold employed her greatest skill in advance: designing and making up to eighty scissors-cut valentines to present to each of the unmarried guests and mounting them with an appropriate poem on red or blue paper."

"The valentine parties ran until 1822 when Elizabeth Cobbold was prevented by illness from holding one as usual, and two years later she was struck down by 'an alarming illness' in July, which, returning in October, rendered her unconscious for the week before she died on 17 October 1824."

"Elizabeth's portrait conveys a comfortable, lovable personality; posthumous tributes praised her very diverse skills, but it is only the productions of her scissors that have enduring merit."

## "Thesis"
While Knipe is best known as a cut paper artist, her collection of *Six Narrative Poems* deserves critical attention for its interaction with the movement to abolish slavery in Liverpool.
